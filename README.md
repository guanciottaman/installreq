# Installreq

This package will install and run every package found in a script and run the actual script with information logging so the user knows what packages are installed and if there are any errors.

It also installs the requirements.txt file (if any).

Installing is simple: just type this command in the terminal:

`pip install installreq`

or download the code with:

`git clone https://github.com/guanciottaman/installreq`

and then run:

`py setup.py install`
